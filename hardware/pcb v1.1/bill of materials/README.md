The BNC connectors can be purchased from aliexpress for some cheeper.


For the capacitor divider tuning you will want to order additional capaictors to to ones in the BOM

the configuration is 56pF and 1pF or 1.3pF (refer to schematics)

Here are some relavent additonal values to purchase to aid in tuning the circuit.

Maybe buy 0402 caps:
top side: 54pF, 56pF, 58pF

bottom side:(the bottom side is more sensetive so it might be easier to tune from this side)
.5pF, .75pF, 1pF, 1.3pF
